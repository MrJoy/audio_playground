https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_frequency

The voiced speech of a typical adult male will have a fundamental frequency from 85 to 180 Hz, and
that of a typical adult female from 165 to 255 Hz. Thus, the fundamental frequency of most speech
falls below the bottom of the "voice frequency" band as defined above.


In telephony, the usable voice frequency band ranges from approximately 300 Hz to 3400 Hz. It is
for this reason that the ultra low frequency band of the electromagnetic spectrum between 300 and
3000 Hz is also referred to as voice frequency, being the electromagnetic energy that represents
acoustic energy at baseband.
